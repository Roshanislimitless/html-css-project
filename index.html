                Avengers ENDGAME:
                Marvel’s epic is a glorious love letter to MCU fans, overflowing with laughs,
                shocks and tears.
            </h1>
                <p>
                    It’s been a very long year waiting for what is clearly the most secretive movie ever made.
                    Just how do you follow up Avengers Infinity War’s jaw-dropping finale where Thanos snapped
                    his fingers and murdered half the universe? By totally surprising and overwhelming fans
                    with its follow up.The first thing to say is that Avengers Endgame is a five-star film for fans,
                    while as a general movie it’s closer to a solid four.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Just as its predecessor, the acting, comedy,pathos and CGI are all up to scratch, which
                    is incredibly impressive considering the scale of the thing After the first fifteen minutes
                    replayed every Avengers Endgame trailer we’d already seen, the first monumental shock was
                    the sudden dispatching of Thanos when Thor finally went for the head, followed by a
                    five-year time jump. After this, we just knew the posters had been lying to us.The well-held rumours proved to be true that time travel
            through the Quantum Realm was the plan.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            The time heist itself was a wonderful way to pay tribute to the MCU’s first decade,
            revisiting the Battle of New York, Thor The Dark World’s Asgard and Guardians of
            the Galaxy-era Morag and Vormir.
            Russo Brothers certainly used the second act of the Endgame to celebrate
            Although,Black Widow’s death was a tragic moment not to be overlooked and proved the
            stakes and cost remained high as the directors promised.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Not only was there a pre-main battle punch-up between the trinity of Iron Man,
            Captain America and Thor, but the Avengers assembling before Thanos’ forces was unbelievably
            impressive.Highlights have to be Cap being worthy to wield Mjolnir, the female superheroes
            combined-attack on Thanos, Captain Marvel smashing up the Mad Titan’s ship and, undoubtedly,
            Iron Man’s snap.
            <br>
            <br>
            We’re sorry, but, it had to happen. The perfect conclusion to Tony Stark’s narrative arc saw a
            narcissistic, womanising billionaire grow over 10 years of character development to be in a place
            where he selflessly gave his life as a Messianic sacrifice to save the world. What a way for Robert
            Downey Jr to bow out.
            <br>
            But it didn’t end there. The endings that follow gave the fans just what they wanted and more.
            Thor made Valkyrie the Queen of Asgard before joining the Guardians of the Galaxy. Joining their
            cosmic team is just right for the Norse god after exploring his comic side in Thor Ragnarok and
            with the Guardians in Avengers Infinity War. No doubt, Hemsworth will return for Guardians of
            the Galaxy Vol 3.
            <br>
            And what could be more right for Captain America than to sneak off back to the 1940s after
            returning the Infinity Stones to finally dance with Peggy and have the life he always wanted
            with her.
            <br>
            For some audiences, Avengers Endgame may be too fan-servicey and overstuffed.
            But hopefully, for the majority, Avengers Endgame will be remembered in the years to
            come as the unprecedented achievement that it is. A hilarious, surprising, shocking,
            tearful epic that will define a generation of blockbuster cinema just as The Empire
            Strikes Back did. The Endgame may be over, but the future is looking bright for the MC
